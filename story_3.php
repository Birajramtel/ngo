                <p>
                    On the date 2035-4-18 BS Laxmi B.K was born as a second child of Mr. Tika Bahadur Bishowkarma
                    and Mrs. Naradevi Bishowkarma at Pipal Dada, Sindhupalchok district. All the family members were
                    very happy on her birth but the happiness didn't last long, as her mother died when she was small.
                    Laxmi didn't got a chance of going to school, rather than going to school she used to be busy
                    taking care of her small brothers and sisters, household works, cow and goats herdsman. At the
                    small age of 11 she used to go for labor. She used to get 10 rupees per day. <br>
                    Days were passing by, as per the rituals of the society she got married at the early age of 13 on
                    date 2048 to 18 years old Mr. Makar Bahadur Bishowkarma living at Chautara-6, Kubinde. She was
                    totally unknown about what marriage was and she didn't knew that she have to do a lot of work as
                    well, even for bringing the water it used to take around 3- 4 hours, sometimes she used to fall
                    down and all her time and her effort used to be wasted. She used to go to jungle for the grass for
                    livestock but couldn't carry more and less was not enough. She used to get scolded and sometimes
                    beaten by her husband and her mother in law. She couldn't eat full appetite even at time when she
                    got hungry. All her past seemed like a dream to her now. Until the age of 24 she gave birth to 3
                    children's but she never went to hospital or clinic for the checkup despite, she didn't even knew
                    that she have to go for the checkup. She didn't get to eat full appetite after the delivery and
                    even couldn't get proper rest as well. She used to do all the household works just after 2-4 days
                    of delivery and even used to go to work in the fields after 10 -12 days of delivery. While talking
                    about her past she had tears in her eyes but her confidence level never decreased and she always had
                    a will of learning new works. <br>
                    I didn't knew, what is a Group? What are the benefits of the being a part of group for us? I used to
                    wonder while other woman's used to tell they have a group meeting today. Slowly women's of my society
                    also started talking about the groups the social mobilizer's representing an organizations also
                    started to explain about the importance of the group but I didn't used to have a confidence in me
                    that even the lower class (dalit) women's like us could be a part of the group and work with other
                    women's. Slowly we established a group named Srijansil Women Saving Group on the date 2071-4-1 BS
                    until then we didn't know that we have to elect the chairperson, vice chairperson, secretary and
                    treasurer, i was hearing this for the first time. After discussion the group members elected me as a
                    chairperson but I couldn't sleep the whole night thinking that I may not be able to fulfill the
                    responsibilities handed over to me by the members. I was afraid and nervous because I couldn't even
                    say my name in front of the mass, I was afraid about how to speak, what to say about group in front
                    of the social mobilizer's of an organization but slowly I started to fulfill my responsibilities. <br>
                    We made a group and started to do savings also but I was afraid that the social mobilizer's may take
                    our savings and run away. Time was passing by, and then 2 members of our group were given a chance to
                    join the farmer's educational tour to Sindhuli. The group decided to send me and selected one other
                    member and we went for the visit, there we met other new women members of other women groups and
                    listening to their experience I started to have a trust on the organization and social mobilizer's.
                    The objective of the visit was to observe and gain knowledge about the activities of the groups
                    conducted by other women like us. Observing the activities like stall improvement, vermicompost
                    production, vegetable farming, cultivation of fodder grasses, collection of the wasted water and
                    its utilization I realized that if we have a will to do the things there is always a way and I
                    thought implementing the things I have learned from the tour and also thought of encouraging the
                    other group members also. On the next day we returned from the visit I made a plastic pond for the
                    collection of the wasted water and went Chautara to buy vegetables seeds. I started the vegetable
                    farming by taking the advice of the social mobilizer's of the BBP Pariwar and in that year I earned
                    around 8000 rupees by selling the vegetables that year. The next year I was able to generate an
                    income of 10000-12000 by selling vegetables like, chilly, tomatoes, string beans (Bodi), onion and
                    green leaves, I am planning to extend the vegetable farming. Especially the people in my caste do
                    not cultivate vegetables my relatives also started cultivating the vegetables watching me. <br>
                    Nowadays I don't have to depend on my husband for saving in the group rather I am giving the money
                    that I have earned from vegetables to my husband and even I have planted some fodder grasses and
                    started the livestock husbandry also, now I can fulfill my desires, there was a time when I couldn't
                    even eat the food I liked, buy the things I liked, my sisters used to buy the things for me but now
                    they are happy that I able to fulfill some of my desires. I developed a confidence even to speak in
                    front of the mass, I am able to convince the members of my group, BBP Pariwar is also supporting us
                    well, and slowly I have a thought of registering the group in agriculture and livestock and I am also
                    discussing with the group members as well. <br>
                    I heartily thank BBP Pariwar and the social mobilizer's of BBP Pariwar for providing the opportunity
                    for the women's of the lower casts like us and the women of the backwarded communities and the support
                    provided for making us self dependent.
