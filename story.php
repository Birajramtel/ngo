                <p>Born on Dec 13 1983 on Sindhupalchok district Sano Sirubari VDC as 3rd children of Mr. Kedarnath Aryal
                    and Mrs.Chitra Kumari Aryal among 7 children's, without any formal education Bina's childhood was not
                    good at all. At early age of 8 due to family issues she was child labored in a house in Chawuni-
                    Kathmandu, at a very small age she was forced to word from morning 4-o-clock until 10-o clock at night.
                    Cleaning the five stored house, washing dishes, sending the children's of the house owner who were almost
                    same as her age to the school and bringing them back, watching the children's of her age going to school
                    she also dreamed of going to the school but her dreams never turned into reality, she was not doing
                    households works only but she was also working in the chicken husbandry collecting the eggs of the chicken,
                    while sometimes she used to sleep while collecting the eggs and used to wake up when scolded by the owner.
                    During Saturday she used to wash the clothes of her house owner and his family. Taking a flash back of her
                    past she never thought of getting the life she is living now for her everything seems like a dream.
                    While meetings her friends and family after seven years she felt like she got a new life and her struggling
                    days were over but her happiness didn't last long when she found out that she was taken home to get married.
                    She said she was shocked when she heard that she was getting married and wanted to run away from there but
                    there was nothing she could do. <br> On the date 2056 at the early age of 15 she got married to Mr.Tika Prasad
                    Gautam of Kubinde-6, Sindhupalchok and got separated form father in law and mother in law just after 3 months of
                    marriage both of them were just children's when they have to face difficulties for fulfillment of their basic
                    needs like food and shelter, they didn't used to have any knowledge and plans about the future. After some
                    time Bina's husband left home in search of work for 3 years while Bina have to face many difficulties during
                    this period sometimes she couldn't even eat full appetite also but she never told anyone about the difficult
                    situation she was facing not even to her father and mother due to superstitions in the society, After some
                    time her husband learned construction work and at 2064 BS they took loan and build their house which relieved
                    Bina somehow. Bina's first child was born at age of 18 but when she reached age of 27 she gave birth to 4 more
                    children's which added more responsibilities and more struggle for them. Slowly she started to get involved in
                    the other activities in the village she wanted to join the women groups established in her village, wanted to
                    do new works but she couldn't do it because she was not involved in any women groups due to her financial
                    status since the groups were established long time ago and she didn't used to have that much money. Slowly
                    she started to explain the importance of group and make the other women's in the village aware about the
                    benefits working in the group rather than working isolated as a result she was successful to establish a
                    women group named Shrijansil Women Saving Group on 2071-4-1 BS with 15 members with the help of BBP Pariwar.
                    While the regular events were being carried out by the groups the group members decided to send me to the
                    leader farmer training being conducted on Sindhuli with the support of the BBP Pariwar (support of world
                    Neighbors) and SIDS Nepal Sindhuli on 2071-9-4 BS till 2071-9-11 which lifted up my self confidence and
                    after the training I started to relay the things that she have learnt to the group members and started to
                    practice in my behavior as well. Then I established a plastic pond to collect the wasted water and started
                    the cultivation of vegetables and tomatoes in the wasted land. Although i was not able to take good care
                    due to the big earthquake last year (2072BS) I sold the garlic and onion of 5000 rupees, tomatoes of 7000
                    rupees, which increased my self confidence and motivated me to do the farming with business motive. This
                    year my target is to generate 40000 rupees form vegetable farming. I have cultivated vegetables like tomatoes,
                    garlic, onion, green leaves, cucumber, pumpkin, potatoes etc. I have received rupees 17000 from tomatoes
                    until now other vegetable farming is also good. I am not using any pesticides or chemical feces in the
                    vegetables rather I am using the vermicompost, organic pesticides produced at home. I am able to fulfill
                    the needs of my children's as I am able to generate income from farming. I have a will to do more work and
                    to be a leader farmer and I wanted to bring change in the life of other women members of my group. <br>
                    I am very thankful to the organization for sending me in the leader farmer training which helped me to develop
                    my self confidence.
