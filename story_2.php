                <p>There is a saying that “life is a struggle” where we have to face unexpected events
                    and difficulties. This is a story of Sabitri Giri of Kavre Mahadevsthan born on 2026
                    on the month of Jestha; she was the first child among 4 children's of Mr.Sovit Bharati
                    and Mrs. Kali Bharati. At that time due to social tradition she was deprived from education,
                    she was busy taking care of her small brothers and sisters and doing household works rather
                    than going to school due to which she can't even write her name as well. <br> Time was passing
                    by; at the small age of 13 years she got married to Mr. Ram Bahadur Giri of age 26 living in
                    Mandandeupur-9, Kavre. She has to take responsibilities at the small age while other child's
                    used to go to school, play and her husband also mostly used to stay outside due to Army's job,
                    she was taking all the responsibilities of the house. At the age of 15 she gave birth to a child
                    but she couldn't save him more than 10 days. She stated that if there was facility of clinic and
                    the regular checking she wouldn't have lost her child. She gave birth to 2 children when she
                    reached 20 but she stated that she never got a chance to go for the checkup, neither she knew
                    about the reproductive health nor her family member made her understand regarding the checkup
                    during pregnancy. <br>I was interested to be involved in a group watching her neighbors being
                    involved in a group. Finally i got involved in Bacchaladevi Women Saving Group on Falgun 2073,
                    on the same date i got involved in a group; BBP Pariwar organized a health awareness program
                    especially focused on the cancer of the cervix. And the social mobilizer's of the BBP Pariwar
                    had informed all of the members of the group to attend the camp for the checkup for cancer of
                    the cervix which was going to be held on Samaj Sewa Samuha Kuntabesi on the date 2073 Chaitra
                    19. But i didn't pay any attention because i felt like i was healthy, as i never felt any
                    symptoms. And felt like why should I do the checkup? But considering the words of the social
                    mobilizer's i thought of checking up once just to be clear regarding my health status. <br> On
                    the date of the camp i.e. 2073-12-19 i went to Samaj Sewa Samuha for the checkup and was found
                    positive in the VIA Test. At first I didn't understood what was the meaning of VIA Positive,
                    Sisters conducting the camp informed me to do the checkup in Banepa city once. Following the
                    instruction of the sisters I went to Banepa for the checkup and from Banepa the doctor recommended
                    me to Bhaktapur cancer hospital and I went there. After i checked up at Bhaktapur cancer hospital
                    I got the report on the 7th day and found out that i was on second stage of cervix cancer, everyone
                    of my family members were shocked when they knew about my report because we used to hear the rumors
                    that cancer patients will not survive and felt like I was going to die soon, at that time all I
                    could think of was about my family members and started to cry. The doctors started to consult me
                    and told me not to worry and informed me that I was in the initial stage and informed that I would
                    be cured and they have to start the treatment. According to the advice of the doctors I had to
                    undergo 5 chemotherapies. I got the first chemo on date 2073-2-4, after the chemotherapy i felt
                    very weak I was not able to walk also during that time I felt like I was about to die watching my
                    condition my husband was angry and started to blame sisters of BBP Pariwar thinking that her wife
                    was fine but they made me sick and I will die but the reality was that I was about to get a new
                    life because of them. But slowly with the help and support and care of BBP Pariwar I was able to
                    develop self confidence. My hair started to fall when I was undergoing the second and third chemo,
                    observing the other patients on the hospital I thought that I came for the checkup early, after my
                    4th chemotherapy the doctor told that there was no need of the 5th chemotherapy. My health condition
                    was getting better and after 3-4 months of the treatment at Kathmandu finally I got cured and came
                    home I am fine now, I can do some households works, I can walk for the monthly meetings of the group.
                    <br>I am very thankful to BBP Pariwar for providing me a new life; maybe I couldn't be alive even
                    after getting the treatment if I was not suggested for the checkup on time by the staffs of the BBP
                    Pariwar, if the treatment was started late may I couldn't be saved by money. Now I am even convincing
                    the other women's in my society as well to do the checkup and I am very thankful once again to the
                    Social Mobilizer's and the BBP Pariwar for providing me a new life.
